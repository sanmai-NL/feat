An R package that converts a parsed Dutch text document collection to a (sparse) design matrix with variables for each observed flat-sequential (word n-grams) and structural (parse graph trail n-grams) feature, using SRILM and custom code. Currently only the Alpino XML parse format is implemented, limiting applicability to documents in Dutch.
