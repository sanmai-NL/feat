Description: Extracts from a collection of XML trees a (sparse) design matrix
    with variables for linguistic surface (word n-grams) and/or structural features (syntactic
    trails) of textual objects. Objects are specified with one or more observations (rows)
    in an annotations table. Such objects can f.i. be text segments or single sentences, provided
    that they can be extracted from some XML document based on an XPath. The structural
    feature representation developed in this package, linguistic networks, are graph unions of those XML trees.
    The unions are multidigraphs with arcs labeled with attribute (name, value) pairs of elements. For example,
    given dependency tree encoded as XML, arcs can be considered labeled
    with linguistic dependency relations between words in the syntax tree. Trails in
    these linguistic networks are randomly sampled, and finally treated as sequences of
    arcs from parent to child elements, from which n-grams can be extracted as well.
